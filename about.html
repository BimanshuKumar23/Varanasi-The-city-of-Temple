        <h1><center>Varanasi</center></h1>
    <p><b id="var">Varanasi</b> provides you information to plan a visit to Varanasi, the ancient city and pilgrimage site in Uttar Pradesh, India. For many Hindus stands as the ultimate pilgrimage site. Although nobody really knows when Varanasi was founded, the city has been documented as one of the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world. Variations to the spelling of Varanasi includes Banaras, Benares and Benaras. These were frequently used during the British administration, and indeed older books continue to show it as Benares. Today, however, only Varanasi and sometimes Banaras is commonly used.
    The city of Varanasi covers 1,550 sq km (600 sq mi) and has a population of 3.7 million people (2012 estimate). It is located in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India.
    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Varanasi derives its name from two streams, the Varuna on the north of the city, and the Assi, a small trickle on the South. According to legend, the Varuna and Assi rivers originated from the body of the primordial person at the beginning of time. Varanasi is also known to the Hindus as Kashi, which means City of Light, and it is regarded as one of the seven Sacred Cities of Hinduism. The word Kashi originated from the word "kas", which means to shine. Varanasi is said to combine all the virtues of other pilgrimage sites, and anyone dying within the area marked by the Panch Kosi Road is believed to be transported straight to heaven.
    </p>
    <h3>History of Varanasi</h3>
    <p>
        The history of Varanasi is shrouded in the fog of time. According to myth, Varanasi was founded by the Hindu deity Shiva. For that reason, it is one of the most important pilgrimage sites in Hinduism. With many ancient text mentioning the city, suggesting that it has already been inhabited over 5000 years ago, Varanasi lays claim as being the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world.</p>

     <p>Varanasi was occupied by the Muslims from the 11th century, when it was conquered by Mahmud of Ghazni in 1033. This resulted in the destruction of all its Hindu temples. The stones were taken from the temples to build mosques. Only in the 16th century, under the Mughal emperor Akbar was the freedom to worship relaxed. But this was shortlived, for under the reign of Emperor Aurangzeb, Hindus once again faced persecution. A Muslim zealot, Aurangzeb renamed Varanasi Mohammadabad. Varanasi was only unshackled of its Mughal overlords by the Marathas, a group of warrior-class Hindus, in the 18th century. It became an independent kingdom in the 18th century, only to fall under British rule in the subsequent century, and was absorbed as one of the cities of the state of Uttar Pradesh in the independent Republic of India.</p>

    <h3>Varansi Geography</h3>
    <p>
        Varanasi is located on a curve of the Ganges. Like Varanasi, the Ganges is considered one of the holiest rivers in Hinduism. It is on the eastern part of the state of Uttar Pradesh. To arrive in Varanasi, I took an overnight train from Delhi, along with three other members of AsiaExplorers.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Varanasi Climate
    </h3>
     <p>From personal experience, I can say that Varanasi is pretty hot, even in November, when I visited, hotter than Delhi, and certainly much hotter than Kashmir. This is especially so during the afternoon, which was when I explored the banks of the Ganges. I learn that the temperature only starts to drop between December and February, when the cold waves blows down from the Himalayan mountains. Fog is common in winter. In summer, a hot dry wind called loo further dehydrates the city.</p>
    
    <h3>Getting There</h3>
    <p>Varanasi is most easily approached by train. There are regular train services between Delhi and Varanasi. It can also be reached by train from Agra and Mumbai. The train journey from Delhi departs in the evening and arrives the following morning. There are two railway stations serving Varanasi. The Varanasi Junction station is located at the heart of the city, and is just a short rickshaw ride from the ghats. To buy your train ticket online, go to the IR Online Passenger Reservation Site (https://www.irctc.co.in/).

        You can also fly to Varanasi from Delhi. The Varanasi Airport (VNS), 25 km outside the city, is served by Indian Airlines, Air Sahara, Jet Airways, Kingfisher Airlines and SpiceJet, among others.</p>
    <h3>Getting Around Varanasi</h3>
    <P>There are auto rickshaws as well as "manpowered" rickshaws. Bargain and determine price before you climb on board, and even then, the rickshaw rivers will try to take advantage of you if they can. As earlier mentioned, you can come to Varanasi from Delhi by train. The auto-rickshaw ride from the Varanasi Junction railway station to Dashaswamedh Ghat should cost you between Rs 20 and Rs 30.

        The best way to explore the ghats along the Ganges is on foot. It provides you the opportunity to view the life in Varanasi up close and at an unhurried pace. You can also hire a boat to take you along the Ganges river. The price, if you are very good at bargaining, should be around Rs 30 per hour per boat. In any case, be prepared to pay Rs 50 for a small boat up to Rs 125 for a large boat. Prices are per boat, not per person. Prices tend to be higher at dawn, when most of the tourist are out looking for boats to see the Varanasi sunrise</P>
        <h3>Pilgrimages to Varanshi</h3>
        <P>Throngs of Hindus from around the world converge on Varanasi every day, although on a normal day, the ghats are pretty quiet during the afternoon, and you'd only see the locals by the banks of the Ganges, whether doing their laundry, bathing, repairing their boats, herded lifestock, or simply idling. Most of the pujas happen at dawn and after sunset, when the banks of the Ganges becomes crowded with worshippers and tourists.

            Apart from Hindus, Buddhists also come to Varanasi because it is a mere 13 km from Sarnath, one of the holiest sites for Buddhists, for it is where Buddha is said to have preached his first sermon after achieving Enlightenment.
            </P>
        <h3>Varanshi Travelogue</h3>
        <p>To be in Varanasi is in itself an experience, and for some, a journey of self discovery. I had the great privilege of visiting Varanasi in November 2004. I must tell you, Varanasi is an experience like no other city I have been before or since. Following an overnight journey from Delhi, we arrived at the Varanasi Railway Station, and then got a motor ricksaw to take us into the heart of Varanasi. There were four of us, all members of AsiaExplorers. There, within the labyrinth of alleyways, we booked into a guest house within walking distance of the Ganges river. We stayed in Varanasi for three days and two nights, and discovering a few days in the life by the banks of the holiest river in Hinduism.

            A great part of the city of Varanasi consists of the labyrinthine alleyways. It is easy to get lost in the labyrinth, and I am sheepish to say that I did get lost once as well, though I prided myself for usually having a good sense of direction. It took me close to an hour of desperate retracing of my steps to get back to surroundings that looked familiar.
